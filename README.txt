README for version 1.2.1


I have created this software/script/site/management interface for the purpose of administrating my email server. And i decided to give it away to others who might need it.
I made it with the ISPmail guide (http://workaround.org/ispmail) in mind, and it works with the database you create when following that guide.

requirements:
	- A webserver with PHP support
	- Javascript enabled in your browser
	- Cookies enabled in your browser
	- Access to the mysql server containing your "Mailserver" database from the webserver

>>>>>>You have to set your database settings in includes/config.php<<<<<<<<<<<



If you find any errors, or have some improvement, fixes, bugs or have any suggestions then please email me at mat@ssdata.dk

Even if this tool has password access, you should only allow your own IP og local ip range to access the page with a .htaccess file on your webserver!

If you need to search on the site, use the browsers CTRL+F feature.

This software/script/site/management interface is free, for both commercial and private use.
You can make changes, give it to others, whatever you want with it, but i do require that you always leave the footer like it is at the bottom saying "This tool was made by Steffan Slot (http://mat.ssdata.dk)" and leave the README.txt and changelog.txt like i set it.
If you make guides, or other pages on the internet on how to install MAT, please write a link to http://mat.ssdata.dk on the same page so people know where to get the latest update.


I made this tool in a hurry, so it's not the best code, but it works :) Like i said, please sent any improvements to mat@ssdata.dk and i will upload a new release with the changes!
There also might be some typo's and spelling mistakes. English is not my native language and didn't have time to spell check the entire thing.

Use it at your own risk, maybe try it on a test database first!
